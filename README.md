The project looks simple on the outside and people may wonder why I chose so complicated approach instead of just making a web page with a constructor. There are few reasons. First and foremost, I wanted to show that I can work with Microsoft technologies, front end, back end, planning and security. Second, I wanted to learn more. I connected smtp, azure key vault, coded all the pages and DB. On top of that, this project references AzureSamples.Security.KeyVault.Proxy.
